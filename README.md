# Datatable Example
Laravel project that displays a dynamically created datatable using the [Age of Empires 2 API](https://github.com/aalises/age-of-empires-II-api)


* The datatable is created using [datatable.net](https://datatables.net/) and styled as a Bootstrap 4 datatable using [MDBootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/jquery/tables/datatables/).

* The data is first retrieved from the API and then saved into the local database.

* The data from the database is then displayed in the functional datatable.

* The functions of the datatable are editing and deleting the data from the database.
